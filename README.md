# Sudoku Challenge
 
Description: This project is aim to use optization to solve four datasets of the sudoku game. Since the problem fits the framework of linear programming, I'll be using LP combined with recursion method.

## Compile/Run the code

One can run the code by downloading the three python files: constraint.py, functions.py, and sudoku_solver.py and run them with the file test.py. 

## Contributors
This project is written by Haley Feng with the help of the starter code provided by the professor and idea from "A Warm Restart Strategy for Solving Sudoku by Sparse Optimization Methods" by Yuchao Tang, Zhenggang Wu, Chuanxi Zhu1. Link of paper: (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.05995.pdf)
